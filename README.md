# This application splits into two parts:
The V1, which uses a fabric client to automatically toggle the key repeating sequence based on the item you're holding through communicating with the desktop program.
The V2, which doesn't require you to run a fabric client, but requires you to additionally bind a key which toggles the key repeating sequence off instead.
