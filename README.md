# This application splits into two parts:

The V1, which uses a fabric client to automatically toggle the key repeating sequence based on the item you're holding, through communication with the desktop program.

The V2, which doesn't require you to run a fabric client, but requires you to additionally bind a key which works like a manual alternative for the key repeating sequence toggling automation featured in V1.
